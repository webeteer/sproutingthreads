                                <p><strong>sprouting threads</strong> is an internet based subscription service through which subscribed parents receive a shipment (“box”) of pre-selected clothes for their child to match their unique style profile created by the subscriber. Each box contains a preselected quantity/assortment within a preselected frequency determined by the subscriber. A <strong>sprouting threads</strong> account and child profile is required in order to take advantage of the subscription service.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Subscription Availability</h2>

                                <h2>Subscription Service Options</h2>
                                <p>There are different subscription service level options (frequency, quantity, and assortment) available to You. Frequency is how often you wish to receive deliveries (monthly or seasonally). Quantity is the number of items per shipment.

Used items are defined by our used guidelines posted on <a href="http://sproutingthreads.com/rethreads" class="blue-link">reThreads</a> page. Your choice of service level options will affect your subscription fees.
