                                <p><strong>sprouting threads</strong> is a subscription-based children's clothing service. It is our mission to help busy parents keep their children uniquely styled as they grow so quickly each season. To help serve you, we have designed the service with several unique elements to address your children's clothing needs.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>Kids get dirty... and like surprises.</strong> We make it easy for parents to select how many clothes they would like to receive, and whether to receive a season's outfits just before the weather changes, or see something new every month.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>Parents are busy.</strong> We will automatically remind you of your upcoming shipment, our assessment of your child's sizes for the coming season, and your current style preferences; of course, you can adjust these before we send out your shipment.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>Everyone likes variety... and parents like a deal.</strong> We carefully select our new outfits from a range of top children's clothing lines. Families looking for a broader range of special finds can opt for our 50/50 blend of new clothes and reThreads, at about a 20% discount.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>Kids grow quickly.</strong> Once your little ones have outgrown their clothes, you have the option to send them back as reThreads. This service is an easy way to contribute to the 'circular economy,' and keeps your costs down via credits on future shipments.</p><br>
                                <p><strong>Tastes change.</strong> We help parents dress their kids. Of course, our (and their) interests change- we make it easy to revise preferences or pause shipments. As kids grow up, we have less and less say in how they dress. To this end, today we are focused on helping 
parents with pre- and elementary school-aged children.<br>
We hope <strong>sprouting threads</strong> can help you keep your child looking amazing and distinct 
during these most precious years.</p><br>
                                <p>Please let us know how we can better serve you.</p><br>
								Thank you.<br>

                                <p>Jennifer and Ripley Martin founded <strong>sprouting threads</strong> to address a need they have experienced first-hand with their two growing kids. With one girl on a "spring baby" cycle, and one boy on a "fall baby‚Äù cycle - they spent a lot of free time making sure the kids had the right size clothes that were season appropriate, and frequently sorting out too-small clothes to consign or donate. As working parents, they thought there should be a better way to manage this for all of the busy parents out there, and founded <strong>sprouting threads</strong> shortly thereafter.</p>
