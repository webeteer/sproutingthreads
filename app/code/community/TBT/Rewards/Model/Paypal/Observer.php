/**
 * This class is an observer that listens to the paypal_prepare_line_items event dispatched by the Mage_Paypal_Model_Cart
 * class.  As of Sweet Tooth 1.5.0.3, this replaces the rewrite of the Mage_Paypal_Model_Standard class with TBT_Rewards_Model_Paypal_Standard
 * The rewrite is still there for versions of Magento lower than 1.4.1.0 since those previous versions do not dispatch the paypal_prepare_line_items
 * event (and don't have the Mage_Paypal_Model_Cart class actually)
